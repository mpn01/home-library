## üíª Usage 
To use this library first you need to have installed web server with configured PHP and MySQL/MariaDB server.

If web server is working correct, clone this repo:

```git
git clone https://github.com/mpn01/library.git
```

After that, create `connect.php` file with your database credentials matching variables below and put it in directory where you clone this repo.

```php
    $servername = "Your server name" //ex. localhost
    $username = "Your username" //ex. root
    $password = "Your password" 
    $database = "Name of your database" //ex. library
```

To make things easy, follow this structure of database:
